- this repository uses vitest for testing. Never use any other test runner when writing tests
- when testing react components, use the react testing library. This repo provides testing utils in frontend/src/testUtils.
  - the util 'customRender' in 'componentHelper.tsx' returns the initialized 'user' object that can be used to simulate user interactions
  - when creating queries with the react testing library, always stick to best practices and follow the recommended priority for queries; if necessary, improve the component's implementation to facilitate better accessibility and easier testing.
- when you want to run unit test in either of the sub projects (frontend or domain), you can use the command 'yarn vitest run <path/to/file>' from the root folder of the sub project.
